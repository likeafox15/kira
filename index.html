    <h1>The Care and Feeding of Akira Eggtart Onlyfans Braverman</h1>
    <img src="./resources/images/IMG_2405.jpg" id="kira" alt="Kira lounging on her office chair">
    <p>This is my cat, Kira. She loves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>breakfast sandwiches</li>
        <li>her electric blanket</li>
        <li>occasionally chewing on humans</li>
        <li>lounging on the couch</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cat sitting instructions</h2>
    <h3>Kira only requires a few things when you take care of her:</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>two scoops of cat food every day</li>
            <li>refill her water when it gets low</li>
            <li>scoop her litter</li>
            <li>turn on her electric blanket (setting: low)</li>
            <li>play with her a lil bit</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>More info:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>food is in the plastic container near her food and water bowls</li>
        <li>litter box is in the guest room</li>
        <li>the black plastic bin next to the litter box is the litter genie - dump stuff in there then pull the gray tab</li>
        <li>the electric blanket has a 4 hour automatic timer, so don't worry it won't burn down the house if you leave</li>
        <li>toys are in the basket in the living room, or there's a laser pointer and treats on top of the kitchen cart!</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Kira is not allowed:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>to scratch the gray arm chair - please sternly tell her no if she does</li>
        <li>to go outside (she probably won't try very hard to do so)</li>
        <li>to eat entire breakfast sandwiches/pizza slices/bao/anything primarily made of carbs, no matter how much she wants to</li>
        <li>to chew on you (but madeline always lets her so, you know, shrug dot emoji)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>I mean ideally she wouldn't scratch any furniture, but i'm keeping my expectations reasonable and focusing on the gray chair</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>it's good to set achievable goals</li>
        <li>also she can have a <em>little</em> bit of your breakfast sandwich, as a treat</li>
    </ul>
